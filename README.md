# Advanced Computer Architecture 
## course assignment


This assignment focuses on optimizing the performance of matrix multiplication using various optimization techniques. We implemented and analysed multiple optimisation methods, measured their impact on performance, and gained a deeper understanding of the underlying principles that drive performance improvements.
Finally, applying the knowledge gained, we optimised a neural network whose performance is significantly influenced by matrix multiplication.
